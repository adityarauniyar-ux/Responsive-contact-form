# Responsive-contact-form
This project involves creating a responsive and user-friendly contact form using HTML and CSS. The contact form will be designed to work seamlessly across all screen sizes, from desktop to mobile, ensuring an optimal user experience. The form will consist of essential fields such as Name, Email, Subject, and Message, with proper form validation in place. It will also feature a submit button and optional confirmation message once the form is submitted.

Key Features:
1. Responsive Design: The form layout adjusts dynamically for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
2. Form Validation: Built-in validation for required fields like Name, Email, and Message.
3. User-Friendly Interface: Clean, modern design with input fields clearly labeled and well-spaced.
4. Error Handling: Error messages are shown for invalid or missing information (e.g., incorrect email format).
5. Submit Button: Includes a submit button that triggers a form submission and sends data (though actual submission can be simulated for demo purposes).

Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the form and input fields.
CSS: For styling the form, including media queries to make it responsive.
Optional (JavaScript): For enhancing user experience with form validation and interactions.

Objective: The goal of this project is to create a professional, visually appealing, and accessible contact form that works on a wide range of devices. The form will be styled using CSS with a focus on responsive design principles, ensuring that it adapts to various screen sizes and provides an excellent user experience.
